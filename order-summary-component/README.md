# Frontend Mentor - Order summary card solution

This is a solution to the [Order summary card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj). 

This is one of my first projects done as part of the Frontend Mentor challenges. My goal was to practice using html and css and creating a responsive design.

## The challenge

- achieving the look as close to the design as possible
- responsive design of the component
- accurate reproduction of the design
- hover states for interactive elements

## Built with

- HTML5
- CSS 
- Flexbox
