# Frontend Mentor - Single price grid component solution

This is a solution to the [Single price grid component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/single-price-grid-component-5ce41129d0ff452fec5abbbc).

In this project, I focused on learning the CSS Grid and using naming according to the BEM methodology.

## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

## Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS 
- CSS Grid
- BEM methodology
